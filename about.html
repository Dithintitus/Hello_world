        <p><div class="name"><p>Brian Kernighan</p></div>
        He is a prominent computer scientist known for his pioneering work
        in the development of programming languages and Unix operating systems.<br> 
        He worked at Bell Labs, where he made significant contributions alongside colleagues
        like Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. Kernighan was instrumental in popularizing the
        C programming language and was a co-author of "The C Programming Language" with Ritchie,
        a book that became known as "K&R" C and served as the authoritative guide for the language.<br>
        <br>
        Kernighan is also credited with developing early programming languages such 
        as AWK (with Alfred Aho and Peter Weinberger) and contributing to the Unix operating system.
        His influence on programming extends to education, as he wrote several books on software tools,
        programming, and coding practices.<br>
        <br>
        The phrase "Hello, World!" was first used by Kernighan in the early 1970s in the context of the B programming language,
        which was developed as a precursor to C. The phrase's first documented use was in a tutorial for B,
        where Kernighan chose it as a simple, friendly message to demonstrate the basic syntax of a working program.
        When co-authoring "The C Programming Language" with Dennis Ritchie, Kernighan continued this tradition.
        <br>
        <br>
        The use of "Hello, World!" as an introductory example likely reflects Kernighan's desire to make
        programming approachable and to provide a simple yet effective way for readers to understand how a language works.
        The phrase itself is welcoming, non-threatening, and conveys the concept of outputting something 
        tangibleâ€”a good first step in learning a new programming language. This welcoming and celebratory nature 
        makes it a perfect fit for beginners to see that their code is working, which encourages further exploration</p>

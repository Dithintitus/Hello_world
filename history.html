    <hr>
    <div class="Para">
        <div id="ParaOne">
        <p>The origin of the "Hello, World!" program dates back to the early 1970s. 
        It was first used by Brian Kernighan in 1972 to illustrate features of the B programming language, 
        which was a precursor to C. Later, when Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan co-authored the influential book "The C Programming Language,"
         published in 1978, they used "Hello, World!" as the first example in the book to introduce the basics of C programming.
        The simplicity and universal nature of "Hello, World!" made it an ideal starting point for learners and instructors.
        Over time, it became a tradition across programming languages, symbolizing the first step in learning how to write, compile,
        and execute code. It essentially serves as a rite of passage for many developers.</p>

        <div id="example">
        <p>The program itself typically looks like this in C:<br><br>

        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="ParaTwo">
        <p>It shows how to include a library (stdio.h), 
        create a function (main), and output text,
        which provides a foundational understanding of core programming concepts.
        As new programming languages emerged, they often adopted "Hello, World!"
        as a way to illustrate their syntax, making it a standard across different programming environments.</p>
